# Description: This program reads a map file (ex. france.txt) and uses 
#              a search algorithm to find the shortest path from the start 
#              to the goal. The program will output the path and the cost
#              of the path(s) in a solutions.txt file.

import sys

def main():
    # Parse command line arguments
    # Perform search for given city pairs using specified search algorithm
    # Write results to solutions.txt
